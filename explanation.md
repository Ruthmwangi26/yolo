.For Backend base image used mongo-express which requires Node.js v4 or higher. Since our client is running on version 13.12.0 or higher this worked well reducing the image size to 177mb.
.The client image has been created using mulitistage to minimize on the size. This was done in two stages build stage and package stage. node:13.12.0-alpine was used for the two stages.
